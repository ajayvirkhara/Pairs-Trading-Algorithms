# üìò MSc Pairs Trading Algorithm

## 1. Description
This script implements the original version of a pairs trading strategy developed as part of my MSc dissertation. It tests for cointegration between S&P 500 stocks within a specified sector and simulates a simple mean-reversion trading strategy based on z-score thresholds.

---

## 2. Methodology Overview
- **Universe**: S&P 500 stocks from a selected GICS sector.
- **Data Source**: Yahoo Finance (via `yfinance`), monthly adjusted close prices.
- **Cointegration Filter**: Pairs with ‚â• 60 months of overlapping data pre-2019-12-01 and p-value < 0.05.
- **Regression**: Static OLS on training period.
- **Signals**: Z-score of price ratio. Long if z < -1, short if z > +1.
- **Capital Allocation**: $500 per asset.

## 4. Strategy Steps
### Step 1: Data Preparation
- Scrape S&P 500 tickers from Wikipedia.
- Filter tickers by GICS sector.
- Download monthly price data from Yahoo Finance.
- Drop tickers with missing data.

### Step 2: Train/Test Split
- Non-shuffled split (25% reserved as test period).

### Step 3: Correlation Pre-screen
- Pearson correlation heatmap filtered to |œÅ| > 0.6 to visualize co-movement.

### Step 4: Cointegration Check
- For each ticker pair, compute Engle-Granger p-value.
- Retain pairs with sufficient history and p < 0.05.

### Step 5: Signal Generation
- Select a top cointegrated pair.
- Estimate hedge ratio via OLS.
- Compute spread and z-score.
- Generate signals:
  - **Long** if z < ‚Äì1
  - **Short** if z > +1
  - **Exit** when z returns to within ¬±1

### Step 6: Trade and Portfolio Simulation
- Allocate fixed notional capital per asset.
- Track holdings, cash, and total asset value.
- Compute total portfolio PnL and Sharpe Ratio.

## 6. Usage
```bash
cd msc_algorithm
python pairs_trading_msc.py
```
Optional: override defaults
```bash
$env:SECTOR = "Financials"
$env:DATA_FREQ = "1mo"
python pairs_trading_msc.py
```

## 7. Limitations
- No stop-loss/take-profit logic
- Only backtests a **single** cointegrated pair
- No transaction costs or slippage
- Static hedge ratio
- Fixed z-score entry/exit thresholds
